# rOpenSci Software Peer Review

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

Thank you for considering submitting your package to the rOpenSci suite. All
the packages contributed by community members go through a process of [open peer review](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/01/nf-softwarereview/) to ensure a consistent level of quality for our users. This process also allows us to ensure that your package meets our guidelines and provides opportunity for discussion where exceptions are requested. 

This README is a short intro to Software Peer Review  for you as a potential author or reviewer. For more information, consult our [gitbook "rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review"](https://devguide.ropensci.org/).

**Our [code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/) is mandatory for everyone involved in our review process.**

* [Why and how submit your package to rOpenSci?](#why-submit)
* [Why and how review for rOpenSci?](#why-review)
* [Further resources](#further)
* [Editors and reviewers](#editors)

# <a href="#why-submit" name="why-submit"></a>Why and how submit your package to rOpenSci?

-   First, and foremost, we hope you submit your package for review **because you
    value the feedback**.  We aim to provide useful feedback to package authors
    and for our review process to be open, non-adversarial, and focused on
    improving software quality.
-   Once aboard, your package will continue to receive **support from rOpenSci
    members**.  You'll retain ownership and control of your package, but we
    can help with ongoing maintenance issues such as those associated with
    updates to R and dependencies and CRAN policies.
-   rOpenSci will **promote your package** through our [webpage](https://ropensci.org/packages/), [blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/), and [social media](https://twitter.com/ropensci). Packages in our suite also get a [documentation website that is automatically built and deployed after each push](https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html#docsropensci).
-   rOpenSci **packages can be cross-listed** with other repositories such as CRAN
    and BioConductor.
-   rOpenSci packages that contain a short accompanying paper can, after review,
    be automatically submitted to the
    [Journal of Open-Source Software](http://joss.theoj.org/) for fast-tracked
    publication.
    
If you want to submit a package, read our [guide for authors](https://devguide.ropensci.org/guide-for-authors.html) before opening a submission issue in this repository.

## <a href="#why-review" name="why-review"></a>Why and how to review packages for rOpenSci?

-   As in any peer-review process, we hope you choose to review **to give back
    to the rOpenSci and scientific communities.**  Our mission to expand
    access to scientific data and promote a culture of reproducible research
    is only possible through the volunteer efforts of community members like you.
-   Review is a two-way conversation. By reviewing packages, you'll have the
    chance to **continue to learn development practices from authors and
    other reviewers**.
-   The open nature of our review process allows you to **network and meet
    colleagues and collaborators** through the review process.  Our community
    is friendly and filled with supportive members expert in R development and
    many other areas of science and scientific computing.


To volunteer to be one of our reviewers, please fill out this [short form](https://ropensci.org/software-reviewer/) providing your contact information and areas or expertise. We are always looking for more reviewers with both general package-writing experience and domain expertise in the fields packages are used for.

Please also read [our guide for reviewers](https://devguide.ropensci.org/reviewerguide.html).

### Reviewers and guest editors

We are grateful to the following individuals who have offered up their time and expertise to review packages submitted to rOpenSci.

```{r reviewers, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
if (Sys.getenv("AIRTABLE_API_KEY") == ""){
  Sys.setenv(AIRTABLE_API_KEY = params$AIRTABLE_API_KEY)
}
editors <- c("Noam Ross", "Karthik Ram", "Maëlle Salmon",
    "Melina Vidoni", "Anna Krystalli", "Mauro Lepore", "Laura DeCicco", "Julia Gustavsen")
reviewers <- airtabler::airtable(base = "appZIB8hgtvjoV99D", 
                                table = "Reviewers")
reviewers <- reviewers$Reviewers$select_all()
reviewers <- reviewers[purrr::map_lgl(reviewers$Reviews, 
                               ~!is.null(.)) & 
                         !(reviewers$name %in% c(editors, "???")), ]
# get last names
last_names <- humaniformat::last_name(trimws(reviewers$name))
reviewers <- reviewers[order(last_names), ]
cat(paste0("[", reviewers$name, "](https://github.com/", reviewers$github, ")", collapse = " \U00B7 "))

guest_editors <- guest_editors$`guest-editors`$select_all()
guest_editors <- guest_editors[!(guest_editors$name %in% c(editors, "???")), ]
