# rOpenSci Onboarding

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

Thank you for considering submitting your package to the rOpenSci suite.
All the packages contributed by community members go through a process
of [open peer
review](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/01/nf-softwarereview/) to
ensure a consistent level of quality for our users. This process also
allows us to ensure that your package meets our guidelines and provides
opportunity for discussion where exceptions are requested.

This README is a short intro to onboarding for you as a potential author
or reviewer. For more information, consult our [gitbook “rOpenSci
Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer
Review”](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/).

**Our [code of
conduct](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html#code-of-conduct)
is mandatory for everyone involved in our review process.**

# <a href="#why-submit" name="why-submit"></a>Why and how submit your package to rOpenSci?

  - First, and foremost, we hope you submit your package for review
    **because you value the feedback**. We aim to provide useful
    feedback to package authors and for our review process to be open,
    non-adversarial, and focused on improving software quality.
  - Once aboard, your package will continue to receive **support from
    rOpenSci members**. You’ll retain ownership and control of of your
    package, but we can help with ongoing maintenance issues such as
    those associated with updates to R and dependencies and CRAN
    policies.
  - rOpenSci will **promote your package** through our [web
    page](https://ropensci.org/packages/),
    [blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/), and [social
    media](https://twitter.com/ropensci). Packages in our suite are also
    distributed via our [drat repository](http://packages.ropensci.org/)
    and [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/ropensci/), and
    listed in our [task
    views](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aropensci+%22task+view%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults).
  - rOpenSci **packages can be cross-listed** with other repositories
    such as CRAN and BioConductor.
  - rOpenSci packages that contain a short accompanying paper can, after
    review, be automatically submitted to the [Journal of Open-Source
    Software](http://joss.theoj.org/) for fast-tracked publication.

If you want to submit a package, read our [guide for
authors](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/onboarding-guide-for-authors.html)
before opening a submission issue in this
repository.

## <a href="#why-review" name="why-review"></a>Why and how review packages for rOpenSci?

  - As in any peer-review process, we hope you choose to review **to
    give back to the rOpenSci and scientific communities.** Our mission
    to expand access to scientific data and promote a culture of
    reproducible research is only possible through the volunteer efforts
    of community members like you.
  - Review is a two-way conversation. By reviewing packages, you’ll have
    the chance to **continue to learn development practices from authors
    and other reviewers**.
  - The open nature of our review process allows you to **network and
    meet colleagues and collaborators** through the review process. Our
    community is friendly and filled with supportive members expert in R
    development and many other areas of science and scientific
    computing.

To volunteer to be one of our reviewers, just click
[here](https://ropensci.org/onboarding/) to fill out a short form
providing your contact information and areas or expertise. We are always
looking for more reviewers with both general package-writing experience
and domain expertise in the fields packages are used for.
